# Payer gas sponsorship (ERC-8168)

Sponsoring gas for 8130 accounts with a payer service — the path to gasless
onboarding (account creation + first transaction with zero user ETH). For
account creation and core concepts, read
[eip8130-accounts.md](eip8130-accounts.md) first.

A **payer** is a service that co-signs `payer_auth` to pay gas (sponsored or
in ERC-20). The hosted vibenet payer lives at
`https://api.vibes.base.org/api/vibenet/account/payer` and supports **both**
ERC-8168 modes:

- `mode: "send"` (default) — payer co-signs and submits (`payer_sendTransaction`)
- `mode: "sign"` — payer co-signs only; you broadcast with `eth_sendRawTransaction`

## Sponsor a first transaction (gasless onboarding)

```ts
import type { Hex } from "viem";
import { createPayerClient, sendSponsoredCalls } from "viem/eip8168";
import { waitForTransactionReceipt } from "viem/eip8130";

const payerClient = createPayerClient({
  url: "https://api.vibes.base.org/api/vibenet/account/payer",
});

// Default mode:"send" — payer co-signs and broadcasts, resolving with an
// OBJECT: `{ transactionHash }`. Destructure it. (The declared return type says
// otherwise — see the note below — so TypeScript needs a cast.)
const { transactionHash: hash } = (await sendSponsoredCalls(client, {
  account,
  payerClient,
  accountChanges: [account.createChange], // deploy rides in the first sponsored tx
  calls: [{ to: account.address, value: 0n, data: "0x" }],
  context: { flow: "transact" }, // budgets free grants per (sender, flow)
})) as unknown as { transactionHash: Hex };
const receipt = await waitForTransactionReceipt(client, { hash });
```

No faucet call and no user ETH is needed anywhere in this flow — the payer's
`payer_auth` makes the protocol debit gas from the payer, not the sender.
**Gas only**: if the sponsored calls *transfer value*, the account still has
to hold that value — a sponsored 0.001 ETH tip from a zero-balance account
reverts, a sponsored zero-value call does not.

**Sponsored value transfers must be wallet-wrapped.** `sendTransaction`
auto-routes value-bearing calls through the account, but `sendSponsoredCalls`
does not: `calls: [{ to, value, data }]` throws `EIP-8130 calls cannot carry
\`value\` on the wire` (live-confirmed on the current branch). Wrap the phase
with `encodeWalletCalls` first — and remember the account must actually hold
the value:

```ts
import { encodeWalletCalls } from "viem/eip8130";

const { transactionHash } = (await sendSponsoredCalls(client, {
  account,
  payerClient,
  calls: encodeWalletCalls({
    account: account.address,
    calls: [[{ to: recipient, value: parseEther("0.001"), data: "0x" }]],
  })[0], // one phase → one wallet-routed executeBatch call
})) as unknown as { transactionHash: Hex };
```

For self-submit (e.g. custom RPC / retry control), pass `mode: "sign"` — the
call then resolves with the signed raw transaction, which you broadcast yourself
with `eth_sendRawTransaction`.

**The declared return type is wrong.** `SendSponsoredCallsReturnType` is typed
as a union of hex strings (`SendTransactionReturnType | SignTransactionReturnType`),
but `mode: "send"` resolves with `{ transactionHash }` at runtime —
live-confirmed against the hosted payer. Passing the raw result into
`waitForTransactionReceipt` fails at the RPC layer with
`invalid type: map, expected 32 bytes`, which points nowhere near the cause. The
union also isn't assignable to `Hex`, so narrowing needs `as unknown as`.

## Wire protocol (JSON-RPC over the payer URL)

Under the hood `sendSponsoredCalls` runs the ERC-8168 flow: fetch terms with
`payer_getTerms`, build and sign `sender_auth` with `payer` set and
`payer_auth` empty, then hand off via `payer_sendTransaction` (send mode) or
`payer_signTransaction` (sign mode). `payer_getTerms` +
`payer_sendTransaction` are the required pair every payer implements;
`payer_signTransaction` is optional (advertised in the terms' `methods`).
Rejections come back as JSON-RPC error `-32000` with a
`data: { code, reason }` envelope — branch on the string `code` (e.g.
`BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, `SENDER_LIMIT_REACHED`, whose context includes a
`validFor` retry hint). Full types: `src/eip8168/types.ts` on
the fork branch.

## Notes

- Subsequent sponsored txs omit `account.createChange` — only the first tx
  carries it.
- **Retry `actor is not bound` right after a self-paid deploy.** Account
  config can propagate ~1 block behind the receipt (the same lag as
  `eth_getCode` and config read-backs), and the payer validates against the
  lagging state — a sponsored tx sent in that window is rejected with
  `EIP-8130 validation failed: actor is not bound`, surfaced as viem's
  `InvalidInputRpcError: Missing or invalid parameters`. Neither message points
  at timing. On 2s blocks this was live-reproduced (fails immediately, succeeds
  ~6s later); on today's 200ms vibenet a sponsored send ~0.8s after the deploy
  receipt was accepted first try. Either way: retry on `actor is not bound`
  (sub-second gaps suffice now) or wait for the account's code read-back.
- **The payer itself can run out of ETH**, and it looks nothing like a budget
  rejection: `InvalidInputRpcError` wrapping `Broadcast failed … insufficient
  funds for gas * price + value: have <n> want <m>` from an internal
  `http://base-client:8545` URL (live-hit 2026-08-21). The `have` figure is the
  **payer wallet's** balance. Diagnose with `payer_getTerms` → the `payer`
  address → `eth_getBalance`; on the devnet the fix is to faucet-drip the payer
  address itself. Also: the terms may advertise only a `token` (USDV) offer
  while sponsored `payer_sendTransaction` still works — don't gate on the offer
  list.
- `context.flow` lets the hosted payer budget free grants per
  `(sender, flow)` pair; pick a stable string per product surface
  (e.g. `"onboarding"`, `"transact"`).
